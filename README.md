# foodprint_calculator
This program was made for the HackDuke 2020 hackathon for the project "Foodprint".
The program takes in a CSV file detailing the type of product and production data for the product in order to calculate an estimate for the carbon emissions for that product. This calculation is done using weighted averages dependent on both the types of food that are in the item (full averages in production.csv) and the type of packaging (full averages in packaging.csv). This information is appended to another CSV file which keeps track of all products inputted.
